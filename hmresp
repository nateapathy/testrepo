She is really rising in the city office, and i'm incredibly impressed by her. I had a good insight that she wasn't a particularly empathetic person, but rather focuses on solutions and steps forward rather than sitting in the shit.

Anyway, seeing Jason this evening was great. I talked mostly about Katherine, and how excited I am about that. he cautioned me to not put her on a pedestal, which i appreciate. I got emotional thinking about how my dad would have loved her, and how interested and compelled he would have been by her. he would have been immensely impressed. But thinking about how he will never get to meet her is deeply saddening. I articulated a difference tonight between feeling and seeing him, and imagining him in the audience at my graduation, or just sitting in our living room talking to Katherine was really emotional. but having those insights was really reassuring and helpful, so I'm glad i went."

The drug price inflation one was interesting; it looked I think from 2009 to 2015 and tracked drug price increases for top (>$1bn annually) drugs, the change in discounts over time, and how that compared with inflation in the Consumer Price Index. The main takeaway is that drug manufacturers inflate prices somewhat arbitrarily, and the internal negotiations between insurers and drug cos often leave out the consumer who will end up paying a lot more depending on the hike."

I need the network benefits of having people around me. Also, I still struggle with motivation. Perhaps I need competition more than I need a network. To prove that I know something better than someone else. That was present at Creighton and at Cerner, too. That's not a bad insight.
