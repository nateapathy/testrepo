# testrepo is my R statistics test repository
Anything I am playing around with in R may end up in this repository
I can't guarantee anything in here, nor is everything annotated like it should be.
Most of this will eventually make it on to the blog at nateapathy.com - feel free to check it out for more complete tutorials and step-by-step guides.
I also am very open to feedback - please message me and/or reach out on Twitter (@NateApathy) with thoughts or ideas you have.

Thanks!
Nate
